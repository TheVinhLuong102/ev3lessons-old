As most of you know, we are the founders of <a href="http://www.ev3lessons.com">EV3Lessons</a>. While we have a lot of resources on our site, we don't have everything. There are lots of good resources around. We thought we would share resources other than on our own site that we think will be helpful to others. While the list is not an endorsement of any one resource over the other, we did make sure that every resource reflects our own mission and philosophy to teach without providing solutions.

The main criteria for selection was the following:<br>
1) Focus: Resources must not focus on winning competitions and shortcuts to success, but on learning the concepts and inspiring.<br>
2) Completeness: Resources must be somewhat organized and comprehensive <br>
3) Educators: Resources that focus on educators must be included<br>

There are also other alternative lists you are welcome to refer to: <a href="http://www.damienkee.com/lego-mindstorms-resources/">Damien Kee</a>, <a href="http://stemrobotics.cs.pdx.edu/node/2837"> STEMRobotics</a>, and <a href="http://www.legoengineering.com/online-training-courses/">Lego Engineering</a>.

We will update this guide as we find and review resources.
