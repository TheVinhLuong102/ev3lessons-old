As your team starts to build, you might find that they are running out of parts. It is common to need parts beyond the FIRST LEGO League or Edu MINDSTORMS sets. In FIRST LEGO League, all LEGO-branded parts are permitted, with a few exceptions. Be sure you read the Challenge Documents for details.

### How do I order parts?

To order complete sets, sensors and motors, you can visit <a href="http://www.lego.com">LEGO</a><br> or <a href="http://www.legoeducation.com">LEGO Education</a><br>.  The Home Edition of the EV3 can be purchased from many retailers including Amazon, Barnes and Nobel and Toys R Us.

To order a specific part, you will need to know the LEGO part number.

### How can I find the part number?

Some LEGO elements have their number printed on them. For most, you will need to look up the part number on the inventory list for the set it came from.  For example, the Education Edition of the EV3 Core Set is #45544.  The Home Edition version of the EV3 is #31313.  If you use a site such as <a href="https://brickset.com/">Brickset</a>, you can look up what parts are in the set.  For example, type in "45544" in the Search bar. Then, pick "Parts". It will show you the name, part number, and all the other sets the piece comes in. Once you know the name and part number, you can order that specifc part from stores on Bricklink and Brickowl.

### Where can I buy specific parts from?

LEGO.com and LEGOEducation.com have sets, motors and sensors available for purchase easily. LEGO Pick A Brick can be used for individual parts.  However, if you are looking for particular pieces (e.g. 15M beams, etc), and don't want to purchase a whole set, you can purchase from vendors in online marketplaces such as Brickowl and Bricklink.  When you purchase from these sites, make sure you pick a store with good reviews and lots of purchases. If you want to receive your items faster, pick someone local. You can purchase both new and used parts.

### Where can I buy FIRST LEGO League Challenge Mats from?

FIRST LEGO League challenge mats are not easily available. On stire such as eBay, they tend to be USD$200+. This is quite normal since the only way to purchase a set is to register a team ($225).

1) Try eBay
2) Post on your local FIRST LEGO League Forum or Listserv. Sometimes teams are willing to sell their old sets
3) Contact your Tournament Director. Some of them do loan or sell their sets at the end of the seasons
