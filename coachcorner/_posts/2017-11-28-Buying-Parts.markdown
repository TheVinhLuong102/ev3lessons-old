As your team progresses through the season, you might find that they are running out of parts. It is common to need parts beyond the FIRST LEGO League or Edu MINDSTORMS sets. In FIRST LEGO League, all LEGO-branded parts are permitted, with a few exceptions (e.g. Power Functions and wind-up are not allowed, Sound sensors and Infrared sensors are not allowed, etc). Be sure you read the current year's Challenge Documents for details as what is and is not allowed may change from year-to-year.

### How do I order sets, motors and sensors?

To order complete sets, sensors and motors, you can visit <a href="http://www.lego.com">LEGO</a> or <a href="http://www.legoeducation.com">LEGO Education</a>.  The LEGO Education Core and Expansion Sets combined are the FIRST LEGO League set sold at the time of team registration. The Home Edition of the EV3 can be purchased from many retailers including Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Toys R Us. To read about the differences between the two sets, read <a href="http://ev3lessons.com/coachcorner/2017/01/17/Home-vs-Edu.html">this article</a>.

### How do I order a specific part?

To order a specific part, you will need to know the LEGO part number. Some LEGO elements have their number printed on them. For most, you will need to look up the part number on the inventory list for the set it came from.  For example, the Education Edition of the EV3 Core Set is #45544.  The Home Edition version of the EV3 is #31313.  If you use a site such as <a href="https://brickset.com/">Brickset</a>, you can look up what elements are in the set.  For example, type in "45544" in the Search bar on BrickSet. Then, pick "Parts". It will show you the name, part number, and all the other sets the piece comes in.

Once you know the name and part number, you can order that specifc part from stores on Bricklink and Brickowl by entering the element number in the search bar.  If you cannot find the element number, type the name and it will pull up all closely related elements.

### Where can I buy specific parts from?

LEGO.com and LEGOEducation.com have sets, motors and sensors available for purchase easily. LEGO Pick A Brick can be used for individual parts.  You can also easily purchase parts from vendors in online marketplaces such as Brickowl and Bricklink.  When you purchase from these sites, make sure you pick a store with good reviews and lots of purchases. If you want to receive your items faster, pick someone local. You can purchase both new and used parts. Make sure that the vendor ships to your country.

### Where can I buy FIRST LEGO League Challenge Mats from?

FIRST LEGO League challenge mats are not easily available. You can try marketplace sites such as eBay. You can usually find sets from a past season. Post your request on your local FIRST LEGO League Forum or Listserv. Sometimes teams are willing to sell them at the end of the season.  In addition, contact your Tournament Director. Some of them do loan or sell their sets at the end of the season.s
