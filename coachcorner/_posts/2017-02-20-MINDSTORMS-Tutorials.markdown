As most of you know, we are the founders of <a href="http://www.ev3lessons.com">EV3Lessons</a>. We do our best to provide a comprehensive site for MINDSTORMS users and robotics teams.

There are other good curriculum resources as well. The list we created has websites and books that are designed to inspire and learn from. Their focus is not on winning competitions and shortcuts to success, but on learning the concepts. 

There are also other alternative lists that we want to point you to. <a href="http://www.damienkee.com/lego-mindstorms-resources/">Damien Kee's MINDSTORMS Resources List</a> is also a useful guide and has additional online tutorials for you to look at.  We will update this guide as we find and review resources.
