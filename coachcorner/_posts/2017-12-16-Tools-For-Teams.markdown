A few weeks ago, I asked teams about what tools they would recommend for other teams. Here are the results of the discussion on Facebook Group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLLShareandLearn/">FLL: Share & Learn </a>.  If you would like to share any more, send an email to team@ev3lessons.com.
