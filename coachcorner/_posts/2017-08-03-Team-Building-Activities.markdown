The above photograph is an organized wall full of misalaneous items. There are balls, cardboard, popsicle sticks, cones, bandanas and more.  I love this idea of keeping a random collection of objects. While our own collection is not nearly as organized, I took like to pull random objects toghether to come up with team building activities.


Why practice team building?
Whether you are a FIRST LEGO League team or a corporation, or a boy scout's troop, team building is at the core of learn to work together and appreciating each other.  I have encountered even 4th year teams who do not work well together. Team building activities help these team understand collaboration.
'
If you look at EV3Lessons.com, you will see that there are over 37 Team Building Activities. There are some that are designed as get-to-know-you activities. These are great at the start of the season.  There are some that help teams realize the role that each person plays.  No matter what activity you pick, understand that the goal is for the kids on the team to learn to work together and appreciate one another.
