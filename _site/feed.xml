In particular, we helped to referee the robot game.  There are many observations and lessons that I hope will help other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/ref.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-the-children-speak-for-themselves&quot;&gt;Let the children speak for themselves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best illustrated through an example. Unfortunately, at our event, the exit path went behind tables while games were still in progress. The volunteer staff did their best to keep the aisle clear for the matches. Occasionally, there was a mishap and an exiting team passed right behind two robot operators. After one particular match, an upset adult walked into the game area and complained that his team should get a do-over because they were bumped from the back. The team was actually still signing off with their table referee at the time when the adult jumped in.  I said I would talk to the team. Before the team left, I went over and asked the kids on the team if they were bumped during the run and if it impacted them or their robot in any way.  All the kids unanimously said, “No”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents and coaches, let the kids decide if something bothered them before stepping in. The referees always give the kids the benefit of the doubt and will do their best to rectify the situation. So, coaches, sit back, relax and enjoy the show. Let the kids talk to the referees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-the-children&quot;&gt;Listen to the Children&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the team has issues with one of the mission models and wants to contest the scoring by the referee, all they have to do is politely ask to talk to the Head Referee who will rule consistently across all tables at a tournament. Accept the ruling given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the referee can operate the model by hand to check to see if it is working correctly. There have certainly been cases when the model did not work (even by hand) and and my team was given the points. However, in majority of cases where the model works by hand, it just means the team’s solution was not robust enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we witnessed several instances when adults on the team began arguing for points with the table referee and the head referee. Amusingly, kids on the team had to console the adult, saying, “Coach, let it go.” You know when the kids are calming the coach down that the coach is taking the event much too seriously. This reflects poorly on the team. I hope all team members have the guts to tell their coaches when they are too involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-the-children-make-decisions&quot;&gt;Let the children make decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRST is about the children making the decisions.  It is alarming to see the number of teams that look to their coaches (or walk up to their coaches) in the middle of the run when things don’t go right. We have even seen coaches yell out instructions to the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Droids have never looked at me in six years of competing. They make their own decisions to run a mission or re-run a mission.  In fact, they appear so calm and in sync that table referees and resetters have made comments to me about how independent they are. Making their own decision during tense moments is all part of the program. Let the team decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coachs-role-during-the-robot-game&quot;&gt;Coach’s role during the robot game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the coach’s role?  Let them know when and where they need to be.  Take photos and video. Be the first to congratulate. Be the loudest to cheer regardless of how the run went. Be their supporter, but not the decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Asha Seshan&lt;br&gt;Droids Robotics&lt;br&gt;Pittsburgh, USA</name></author><summary type="html">After six years of competing in FIRST LEGO League, my family had the opportunity to take in a state-level tournament from the other side.

As a teacher and coach of a FIRST LEGO ® League (FLL®) team, I’ve seen and experienced this over the past several years. Even within the FIRST ® program you can learn in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/NXTGeneration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLL® teams are formed within scout programs, technology clubs, youth organizations and voluntary organizations. However, most commonly, they are formed as part of schools, after school programs and home schools. I discovered that diverse teams (in terms of age, level and interest) often get more out the FLL® program than teams with a homogeneous composition. Perhaps this is because team members learn with and from each other, and often learn in a more informal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated in the introduction there are many different ways of learning. According to “van den Dungen &amp;amp; Smith, 2010” one can divide learning into three different types, namely: formal, non- formal and informal learning. The terms, formal, non-formal and informal learning are used by the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), as well as researchers and practitioners around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Formal Learning&lt;/b&gt; is organized learning which is legally regulated and meets quality requirements with fixed targets. It ends with a nationally recognized diploma or
certificate. Professionals who have received training teach the
classes. Schools, colleges and universities fall in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-formal Learning&lt;/b&gt; is often less organized, and does not have to fit in a program. A qualified teacher or a coach with more experience can guide this type of learning. Although the program is not standardized, and has no certification or a diploma, the program is very rewarding and the student learns individual skills and competencies. Scouting or sports groups are a good example. In non- formal learning, enthusiasm, fun and intrinsic motivation are often the driving force behind participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Informal Learning&lt;/b&gt; is learning which is generally not organized. It occurs anywhere including in the family, at work, during leisure time, and in society. We learn a lot and frequently. It is spontaneous and casual, and often the learning happens together with others. We pick up ideas from peers, we ask for help, and we get feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal learning is increasingly seen as an important way of realizing formal and non-formal learning. The teacher is just someone with more experience like a parent, grandparent or a friend. From the student’s point of view, this learning is non-targeted. The learning outcomes are not recorded and are not usually visible to the student. An example of informal learning is a father who teaches his child fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FLL® program fits, in my opinion, between non-formal and informal learning. The program itself is more non-formal because it has been developed and carried out by FIRST ® in a more or less organized setting. With the FLL® program, children develop knowledge and skills, but also other skills such as individual and social competencies. The team members are often inexperienced, and are accompanied by a qualified teacher or a coach with more experience (such as a youth leader, volunteer or parent). The FLL® activities are planned, but are not always structured within conventional time formats or school subjects. Participation in the program is generally voluntary. The setting is mostly outside the classroom, and more informal. The learning outcomes are not recorded, measured or assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the program further proceeds, the students are learning more in an informal way. They get help from
professionals and experts in the field; they go on excursions or investigate and learn spontaneously and accidentally from one another. They work together, care for each other and look with different eyes at their environment. They are assertive; learn to deal with setbacks and opinions of others. They learn to establish contacts; enhance their perseverance and give attention to non-verbal behavior. They also devote more of their free time to this project to find material, and arrange or organize things. But above all, they have a good time and they enjoy what they are doing. They have FUN. The coach or mentor is at this stage often only a spectator, someone who facilitates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a coach, I often got feedback from parents saying that they were grateful that their children had participated in FLL®. The children themselves were glad they had been a member of an FLL® team. They said that they found it fantastic that they had been introduced to engineering and science. They were happy that they now knew how to build a robot and program one.They also developed more spatial awareness. They also loved that they had come to know more about certain subjects, and at the same time had explored the core objectives of primary education. But what they often found even more valuable and important was what they had learned in an informal way. The things they learned are not directly measurable or visible. As the children grew older they and their parents realized increasingly what they had learned and what the impact that FLL® had on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I’m still excited about the FIRST ® program. I’m more and more convinced after all these years that this program should not be seen or used as a formal learning tool that must be guided by professionals. It is in my opinion that it is not a program that should be restricted by age, level, or certain characteristics. The FIRST ® program is for everyone and is an important link between formal, non-formal and informal learning. It is also a connection to the conceptual framework of life long learning. The FIRST ® program is more than just learning skills or abilities. It also develops motivation, experience and talent. As a person you need all of these competencies and you need to always continue to develop and improve them, not only as a team member, but also as a coach/mentor, expert, professional, volunteer, parent, teacher, CEO, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

They were invited to partcipate in many international level events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The FLL program is for everyone: for doers, thinkers, dreamers and decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/NXTGeneration2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-first-lego-league-for&quot;&gt;Who is FIRST® LEGO® League for?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, I have started to notice that the First Lego League program is increasingly being used in Elementary and Junior High school. Unfortunately, however, I also notice that this program is more and more being used as an quick and easy way to implement a program for academically advanced students - those who need an extra challenge, the so called “smart kids”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t every child need an additional challenge? Is it not so that a team, just like a class, can benefit from having a diversity of talents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children who have language and mathematics difficulties are often given extra attention in these areas, which is good. As a result, those same children are confronted with something they’re not so good at over and over again. Sometimes these extra lessons take up so much time that those kids are denied opportunities for of educational, entertaining, and challenging programs such as FLL®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-cooperative-learning&quot;&gt;What is Cooperative Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a FIRST® LEGO® League coach, I noticed that children can learn a lot from each other and from the interactions within an FLL team. The idea behind cooperative learning is that both academically weak and strong children can benefit from the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, children whose social skills are not so strong can learn to be more assertive, and children who may not be so good with language prove to be great robot builders or prove to be fantastic motivational speakers. Children who are shy learn to push their limits and children who Kind it difficult to work together will experience that when you work together you can achieve much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FLL® program is for everyone, for doers, thinkers, dreamers and decision makers. They need each other, they complement each other, and they learn with and from each other’s talents, passion, courage, creativity and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nxt-generation&quot;&gt;NXT Generation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NXT Generation team was successful, not because the team had ten very smart brains, but because they were ten children with the same passion and courage. They had the courage to ask each other for help in the areas in which they themselves were not as good, they dared to correct each other, and encourage each other. They were creative and able to think outside the box because each team member was valued for his/her own style and for his/her own talents. The team did not have preconceptions, therefore everyone felt safe and welcome. They were curious about everything that came down their path and they were so proud of what they had with each other over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLL® is, therefore, in my eyes more than a program only for the “gifted” or “smart” kids. In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FLL® you can be who you are and everyone In FIRST® LEGO® League you work together and learn together, thereby leaving no one out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Angela Wellink&lt;br&gt;NXT Generation &lt;br&gt;Eindhoven, The Netherlands</name></author><summary type="html">NXT Generation competed in FIRST® LEGO® League for many years in the Netherlands.

But it took us a couple of years to embrace it. Hopefully our story can help you to learn this lesson quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Electriclegos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first year as a team (my first year coaching) was Nature’s Fury in 2013. We had 10 kids, all of them new to FIRST LEGO League. As a coach, I studied a lot so that I could do my best to guide the team. We worked hard, we came up with a good project, and at our first qualifier we finished in the top third of the robot game scores. I thought for sure that with all of the work these kids had put in, we would definitely advance to championship. Sadly, we did not. As a coach, it was hard to look at the disappointed faces of my team. I felt like a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My hope for other coaches out there would be that they not only embrace their “failures” but view them as successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an end of the year pizza party and I asked the team if they wanted to continue in the offseason to learn more about programming and robot techniques. The team was excited about this. We learned a lot in the offseason. We watched YouTube videos of teams from the prior season to learn strategy, we experimented with the EV3 to figure out how to do things better, and we continued to bond as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next season, World Class, we hit the ground running. The work in the offseason paid off as we won the Champion’s Award at our qualifier and third place Champion’s Award at the Central California Regional that year. We continued on in the Trash Trek season and won the second place Champion’s Award at the championship that year. But none of that success would have been possible without the “failure” we experienced in Nature’s Fury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, the only failure we had in our rookie season was me, as a coach, focusing too much on advancing to championship and not enough about the lessons learned along the way. After all… What we discover is more important than what we win, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope for other coaches out there would be that they not only embrace their “failures” but view them as successes. Every time your team experiences a failure - whether it’s a robot that doesn’t do what you want it to do, a team that struggles to work as one, or a project solution that isn’t viable - remember that failure is always an option… as long as you learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ken Kirk&lt;br&gt;Electric LEGOs&lt;br&gt;California, USA</name></author><summary type="html">This famous quote from the Mythbusters has become a favorite saying of our team.

&lt;p&gt;During our rookie year (World Class), we were fortunate to extend the season as Louisiana’s Runner-Up for the Champion’s Award. This meant raising $15,000 to defray cost for our 10-person team to attend the North American Open at LEGOLAND in Carlsbad, CA. During the Trash Trek season, our team was awarded Louisiana’s Champion’s Award; landing us the task of raising $11,000 to defray cost of the team’s participation at the FLL World Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising such a large amount of money requires a lot of organization &amp;amp; determination to try anything. The following is a list of our more successful efforts: Hosting Family Lego Night and Adult Fan of LEGO Night, doing presentations at our local Rotary Clubs, Kiwanis, Junior Auxiliary &amp;amp; city administration, creating custom STEM events for Santa Fe Cattle Company, Chick Hil’A &amp;amp; Learning Express Toys, sending out sponsorship letters, selling LEGO arts &amp;amp; crafts, and garage sales. In addition, we asked companies that we regularly do business with if they could assist us. This got us 80 bags from our tourism bureau to hand out in CA and a banner from K-Team Printing for our pit area. We also submitted regular articles to our local paper to keep the community aware of the team’s successes and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve provided demonstrations for Tulane University, SLU, the Louisiana Teacher of the Year Conference and local children’s museums. As a result of this outreach last year, we were awarded a grant through DOW, which was essential in securing the team’s participation in St. Louis.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/Butler/Passion/1/img/3.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning One Step Ahead of Your Students</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/16/Learning-One-Step-Ahead-of-Your-Students.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning One Step Ahead of Your Students" /><published>2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/11/16/Learning-One-Step-Ahead-of-Your-Students</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/16/Learning-One-Step-Ahead-of-Your-Students.html">&lt;p&gt;In late 2015, Iona Primary School won a FIRST LEGO League Robotics grant from FIRST Australia, in partnership with Google.

In the case of a robotics team, “well begun” starts with being organized. This article shares both portable sorting techniques as well as ideas for your robotics lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Sorting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-bother&quot;&gt;Why Bother?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students on your team will find it much easier to build if their LEGO parts are organized and easy to find. It is also much easier for a coach to visually see which parts they are running out of to order more. I have found that students get inspired while looking through their parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping parts organized and easy to find can inspire students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plastic-boxes&quot;&gt;Plastic Boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out in our first year with simple plastic storage boxes. These had small compartments in them. A big negative for this box was that you could not change the size of the compartments and they were rather small for anything other than pegs and smaller beams. Although we outgrew these small boxes for daily use in our robotics room, we still continue to use them to carry spare parts to tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toolboxes&quot;&gt;Toolboxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tool boxes can be easily repurposed for LEGO. A big advantage to the above smaller plastic boxes is that each compartment is bigger (and often adjustable). We know many teams that buy these or similar Stanley tool boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Stanley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tackle-boxes&quot;&gt;Tackle boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some FIRST teams like using tackle boxes (like this one from Plano).  They have many smaller boxes inside for easy sorting and a handle to carry them all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Plano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sorting-bins&quot;&gt;Sorting Bins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text If you have bookshelves in your room, consider removable bins (like this IRIS Medium Stacking Bin). We like the clear bins so that you can see inside them, but they are available in many colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Iris.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rolling-cart&quot;&gt;Rolling Cart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rolling cart such as the TRINITY Double-Sided Bin Rack on the left can be very useful if you don’t have shelving and want the flexibility of moving the parts to different areas of the room. Each of the bins come off the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Cart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-cleans-up&quot;&gt;Who Cleans Up?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No coach or mentor should be left with the clean up work. I realized a few weeks into my first season of coaching that the kids just go when their parents come, leaving me to clean up. So, we instituted a clean-up rule. Ten minutes before pickup time, we stop to discuss what we got done that day and also to clean up!&lt;/p&gt;

We always begin the season with everyone taking turns simply introducing themselves stating their name, age, and grade in our roundtable meeting. The next few meetings, we go around the table, but this time, say your neighbor’s name, age, and grade. (If the neighbor doesn’t know, we encourage everyone to help them out, no awkward silences!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-trust&quot;&gt;Building trust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also include fun, short games that have either a communication or STEM aspect to them, or both. For example, we play a “blindfold remote-control robot” game. We use an extra robot that is remote-controlled to throw a toy ball at a target, but the person with the remote-control is blindfolded (with welding goggles), and the team has to help guide their team mate verbally. Keep it fun and positive, no heckling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another game we use as an ice-breaker is the board game “HedBanz Act Up”. It comes with headbands that use cards. The person with the card on their head does not know what their cards say, but everyone else can read the card. The team members have to help that person figure out what is on their card without using the words printed. This teaches the team to help each other out and communicate positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other way to build confidence among members is take turns at these roundtable meetings to all read through the Rules Manuals together. Letting all team members have a turn reading aloud will build public speaking and presentation skills, and help everyone feel involved and learn together. (Coaches can highlight the important parts beforehand, but dedicate a good few meetings to really go through the rules together, maybe Robot one day, Project the next.)&lt;/p&gt;
