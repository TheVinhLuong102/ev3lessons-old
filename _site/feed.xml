In particular, we helped to referee the robot game.  There are many observations and lessons that I hope will help other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/ref.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-the-children-speak-for-themselves&quot;&gt;Let the children speak for themselves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best illustrated through an example. Unfortunately, at our event, the exit path went behind tables while games were still in progress. The volunteer staff did their best to keep the aisle clear for the matches. Occasionally, there was a mishap and an exiting team passed right behind two robot operators. After one particular match, an upset adult walked into the game area and complained that his team should get a do-over because they were bumped from the back. The team was actually still signing off with their table referee at the time when the adult jumped in.  I said I would talk to the team. Before the team left, I went over and asked the kids on the team if they were bumped during the run and if it impacted them or their robot in any way.  All the kids unanimously said, “No”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents and coaches, let the kids decide if something bothered them before stepping in. The referees always give the kids the benefit of the doubt and will do their best to rectify the situation. So, coaches, sit back, relax and enjoy the show. Let the kids talk to the referees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-the-children&quot;&gt;Listen to the Children&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the team has issues with one of the mission models and wants to contest the scoring by the referee, all they have to do is politely ask to talk to the Head Referee who will rule consistently across all tables at a tournament. Accept the ruling given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the referee can operate the model by hand to check to see if it is working correctly. There have certainly been cases when the model did not work (even by hand) and and my team was given the points. However, in majority of cases where the model works by hand, it just means the team’s solution was not robust enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we witnessed several instances when adults on the team began arguing for points with the table referee and the head referee. Amusingly, kids on the team had to console the adult, saying, “Coach, let it go.” You know when the kids are calming the coach down that the coach is taking the event much too seriously. This reflects poorly on the team. I hope all team members have the guts to tell their coaches when they are too involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-the-children-make-decisions&quot;&gt;Let the children make decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRST is about the children making the decisions.  It is alarming to see the number of teams that look to their coaches (or walk up to their coaches) in the middle of the run when things don’t go right. We have even seen coaches yell out instructions to the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Droids have never looked at me in six years of competing. They make their own decisions to run a mission or re-run a mission.  In fact, they appear so calm and in sync that table referees and resetters have made comments to me about how independent they are. Making their own decision during tense moments is all part of the program. Let the team decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coachs-role-during-the-robot-game&quot;&gt;Coach’s role during the robot game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the coach’s role?  Let them know when and where they need to be.  Take photos and video. Be the first to congratulate. Be the loudest to cheer regardless of how the run went. Be their supporter, but not the decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Asha Seshan&lt;br&gt;Droids Robotics&lt;br&gt;Pittsburgh, USA</name></author><summary type="html">After six years of competing in FIRST LEGO League, my family had the opportunity to take in a state-level tournament from the other side.

Remaining money is used for operating expenses during competition season.

&lt;p&gt;During our rookie year (World Class), we were fortunate to extend the season as Louisiana’s Runner-Up for the Champion’s Award. This meant raising $15,000 to defray cost for our 10-person team to attend the North American Open at LEGOLAND in Carlsbad, CA. During the Trash Trek season, our team was awarded Louisiana’s Champion’s Award; landing us the task of raising $11,000 to defray cost of the team’s participation at the FLL World Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising such a large amount of money requires a lot of organization &amp;amp; determination to try anything. The following is a list of our more successful efforts: Hosting Family Lego Night and Adult Fan of LEGO Night, doing presentations at our local Rotary Clubs, Kiwanis, Junior Auxiliary &amp;amp; city administration, creating custom STEM events for Santa Fe Cattle Company, Chick Hil’A &amp;amp; Learning Express Toys, sending out sponsorship letters, selling LEGO arts &amp;amp; crafts, and garage sales. In addition, we asked companies that we regularly do business with if they could assist us. This got us 80 bags from our tourism bureau to hand out in CA and a banner from K-Team Printing for our pit area. We also submitted regular articles to our local paper to keep the community aware of the team’s successes and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

The word sounds rather strange and, I have to admit, that I had no idea what that term was until our third year in FIRST LEGO League. Informally, swag refers to “products given away free, typically for promotional purposes.” For a FIRST team, this means something small that represents your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Buttons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-swag-required&quot;&gt;Is SWAG required?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Giving away swag is an added expense for your team. If you do not have the resources to do so, don’t. You also don’t have to spend a lot. Get creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buttons/Pins. These range in size from small to large (depending upon your budget). Teams custom print their team’s logo or their project topic on them. I have seen buttons of all kinds: with an LED imbedded in them, made of wood, homemade, professionally printed, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrist Bands. These are silicone wristbands that have the team’s name or motto on them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pencils/Pens: These usually have a team name printed on them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chocolate: Most teams give out popular chocolate brands, but others have made their own LEGO-shaped chocolates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At international tournaments you often see a team give away something that represents their country.  Project Bucephalus and The Knights that Say Ni gave out small koala bears because they are from Australia. NXT Generation from the Netherlands gave out small wooden shoes. Teams from Japan often give out a small craft item (e.g. origami). Some teams will have a few special items (like a team shirt) to give to a team that have a bond with. The Droids treasure these special gifts and wear them proudly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-giveaways&quot;&gt;Free giveaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact your local government. Often they will have brochures or small pins that they will let you have for free. I have seen teams come with state (or regional) pins. Associations often have giveaways they may be willing to give your team. For example, when my team was researching milk six years ago, the Diary Association not only sent them educational videos, but also “Got Milk” stickers, bracelets and key chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-you-get-giveaways-from&quot;&gt;Where do you get giveaways from?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get them as donations to your team. You can make many items (including buttons) yourself if you own the equipment. There are many companies that will print custom silicone bands, buttons, stickers, etc. (e.g. Oriental Trading)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the number of teams attending and multiply by about 6-8 kids per team.  In addition, all FIRST events are also open to the public.

The word sounds rather strange and, I have to admit, that I had no idea what that term was until our third year in FIRST LEGO League. Informally, swag refers to “products given away free, typically for promotional purposes.” For a FIRST team, this means something small that represents your team.



Is SWAG required?

No. Giving away swag is an added expense for your team. If you do not have the resources to do so, don’t. You also don’t have to spend a lot. Get creative.

In the case of a robotics team, “well begun” starts with being organized. This article shares both portable sorting techniques as well as ideas for your robotics lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Sorting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-bother&quot;&gt;Why Bother?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students on your team will find it much easier to build if their LEGO parts are organized and easy to find. It is also much easier for a coach to visually see which parts they are running out of to order more. I have found that students get inspired while looking through their parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping parts organized and easy to find can inspire students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plastic-boxes&quot;&gt;Plastic Boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started out in our first year with simple plastic storage boxes. These had small compartments in them. A big negative for this box was that you could not change the size of the compartments and they were rather small for anything other than pegs and smaller beams. Although we outgrew these small boxes for daily use in our robotics room, we still continue to use them to carry spare parts to tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toolboxes&quot;&gt;Toolboxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tool boxes can be easily repurposed for LEGO. A big advantage to the above smaller plastic boxes is that each compartment is bigger (and often adjustable). We know many teams that buy these or similar Stanley tool boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Stanley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tackle-boxes&quot;&gt;Tackle boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some FIRST teams like using tackle boxes (like this one from Plano).  They have many smaller boxes inside for easy sorting and a handle to carry them all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Plano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sorting-bins&quot;&gt;Sorting Bins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text If you have bookshelves in your room, consider removable bins (like this IRIS Medium Stacking Bin). We like the clear bins so that you can see inside them, but they are available in many colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Iris.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rolling-cart&quot;&gt;Rolling Cart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rolling cart such as the TRINITY Double-Sided Bin Rack on the left can be very useful if you don’t have shelving and want the flexibility of moving the parts to different areas of the room. Each of the bins come off the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Cart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-cleans-up&quot;&gt;Who Cleans Up?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No coach or mentor should be left with the clean up work. I realized a few weeks into my first season of coaching that the kids just go when their parents come, leaving me to clean up. So, we instituted a clean-up rule. Ten minutes before pickup time, we stop to discuss what we got done that day and also to clean up!&lt;/p&gt;

I am a second year head coach and sponsor for my son’s FTC team, #6041 Robot X Games. Here are some ideas we used in FLL as well as FTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To encourage team members to build team bonds and unity, short ice-breaker games can help start your team off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-who-is-who&quot;&gt;Learning who is who&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of a new robotics season, your team might have new members. To encourage team members to build team bonds and unity, short ice-breaker games can help start your team off on the right foot. We always begin the season with everyone taking turns simply introducing themselves stating their name, age, and grade in our roundtable meeting. The next few meetings, we go around the table, but this time, say your neighbor’s name, age, and grade. (If the neighbor doesn’t know, we encourage everyone to help them out, no awkward silences!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-trust&quot;&gt;Building trust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also include fun, short games that have either a communication or STEM aspect to them, or both. For example, we play a “blindfold remote-control robot” game. We use an extra robot that is remote-controlled to throw a toy ball at a target, but the person with the remote-control is blindfolded (with welding goggles), and the team has to help guide their team mate verbally. Keep it fun and positive, no heckling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-team-communication&quot;&gt;Building team communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another game we use as an ice-breaker is the board game “HedBanz Act Up”. It comes with headbands that use cards. The person with the card on their head does not know what their cards say, but everyone else can read the card. The team members have to help that person figure out what is on their card without using the words printed. This teaches the team to help each other out and communicate positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-confidence&quot;&gt;Building confidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other way to build confidence among members is take turns at these roundtable meetings to all read through the Rules Manuals together. Letting all team members have a turn reading aloud will build public speaking and presentation skills, and help everyone feel involved and learn together. (Coaches can highlight the important parts beforehand, but dedicate a good few meetings to really go through the rules together, maybe Robot one day, Project the next.)&lt;/p&gt;

        “Failure is Always an Option”By Ken Kirk The Electric Legitimate Engineering Geniuses Of Science Twitter:  @ElectricLEGOS “My hope for other coaches out there would be that they not only embrace their “failures” but view them as successes.”  Coach’s CornerThis famous quote from the Mythbusters has become a favorite saying of our team.  But it took us a couple of years to embrace it.  Hopefully our story can help you to learn this lesson quicker. Our first year as a team (my first year coaching) was Nature’s Fury in 2013.  We had 10 kids, all of them new to FIRST LEGO League.  As a coach, I studied a lot so that I could do my best to guide the team.  We worked hard, we came up with a good project, and at our first qualifier we finished in the top third of the robot game scores.  I thought for sure that with all of the work these kids had put in, we would definitely advance to championship.  Sadly, we did not.  As a coach, it was hard to look at the disappointed faces of my team.  I felt like a failure.   We had an end of the year pizza party and I asked the team if they wanted to continue in the offseason to learn more about programming and robot techniques.  The team was excited about this.  We learned a lot in the offseason.  We watched YouTube videos of teams from the prior season to learn strategy, we experimented with the EV3 to figure out how to do things better, and we continued to bond as a team.   The next season, World Class, we hit the ground running.  The work in the offseason paid off as we won the Champion’s Award at our qualifier and third place Champion’s Award at the Central California Regional that year.  We continued on in the Trash Trek season and won the second place Champion’s Award at the championship that year.  But none of that success would have been possible without the “failure” we experienced in Nature’s Fury.   In hindsight, the only failure we had in our rookie season was me, as a coach, focusing too much on advancing to championship and not enough about the lessons learned along the way.  After all…  What we discover is more important than what we win, right? My hope for other coaches out there would be that they not only embrace their “failures” but view them as successes.  Every time your team experiences a failure - whether it's a robot that doesn’t do what you want it to do, a team that struggles to work as one, or a project solution that isn’t viable - remember that failure is always an option…  as long as you learn from it.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/Butler/Passion/1/img/3.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Maximize Learning and Minimize Cloning</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/10/02/Maximize-Learning-Minimize-Cloning.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maximize Learning and Minimize Cloning" /><published>2016-10-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/10/02/Maximize-Learning-Minimize-Cloning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/10/02/Maximize-Learning-Minimize-Cloning.html">&lt;p&gt;n this article, I tackle the Internet and the role it can play for a FIRST LEGO League team: the good, the bad and even the ugly. Opinions will vary greatly on this topic.  My opinions are based on 6 years coaching, judging at both regional and international events, and my philosophy on how to get the most out of the FLL for our children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research-project&quot;&gt;Research Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet can be a great tool for an FLL team for the research project. It is the first place the kids go to look up data for their research project and sometimes even pick a topic.  It is a great way to see if your innovative solution exists already! Students can design and distribute surveys and send emails using the Internet. The students may use the Internet to find people or places to contact for their project. There are journal articles, documentaries, and more on the Internet. Help the students understand that although all of these might be “on the Internet”, they are actually different types of sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Internet can be a very useful tool for FIRST LEGO League teams, but use it with caution and teach your team the difference between inspiration and outright copying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t let websites be the only source of information for your team’s research project. Encourage them to use it as a starting point and then move beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not all sources on the Internet are equal. When students present their findings to each other, ask where they got the information from. A personal blog site is not as good a source as an industry website or a National Geographic video.  Such discussions early in the season will help the team get better results with their research project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learning to cite resources and identify trustworthy resources is a valuable skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet-for-sharing&quot;&gt;Internet for Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet can also be a great resource for the robot game, but coaches need to be careful about how Internet resources are used and to make sure that students explore their own creativity first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of FLL is learning how to come up with your own strategy, design and style. For example, watching YouTube videos of other people’s current robots and seeing the “Internet solution” can limit their creativity. This does not mean that such videos cannot be valuable in learning and to get inspired. However, we greatly caution teams from directly copying others’ robot, attachment design, and strategy. Copying another team is not the same as being inspired by the team.  Copying robs the students on the team from thinking creatively and solving problems themselves which is the core of FIRST LEGO League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;FIRST LEGO League teams often think that by showing a video or sharing a photo of their robot’s solution (attachment, robot, strategy, and code) that they are only fulfilling the FIRST Core Value of “sharing”. Giving solutions to a challenge/competion is not sharing. Help the other team by asking questions, offering ideas, inspiring, without actually solving their challenges for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend that teams only watch these videos after their season is done to get inspired for the next. Students could then compare the techniques/strategies used by these teams with their own approach to identify general strategies that work well (e.g. aligning on walls), areas that they can try to improve, and areas where they did a good job. As a coach, you might pick 5 robot game videos (of teams at different levels) for your team to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I recommend that you identify sites that you feel comfortable pointing your team to. For example, some sites such as ev3lessons.com are designed to explicitly avoid giving specific solutions to any FLL mission. Some sites, even ones such as the official FLL forum, have detailed discussions regarding strategies for the current season’s missions that you may want your students to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;judges-evaluation&quot;&gt;Judge’s Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have the students go over the judges’ feedback. How did you do last season? Don’t just look at what column was circled. Read the comments. We know that sometimes you don’t get rubrics back and often there are no comments/no useful comments. Do your best with what you have. Perhaps you, as a coach, or a team parent could give the students additional feedback if the team didn’t receive any. Ask the team these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) How can you implement judges’ feedback into this season? 
2) Did the judges understand what you were trying to say or do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For an experienced team, the season starts where the old one ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-evaluation&quot;&gt;Self-evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important step in improving as a team is being willing to admit that you need to improve. We began this season by asking our team to evaluate themselves. For each part of FIRST LEGO League (Robot Design, Project and Core Values), we asked them to honestly answer three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) What did your team do well in this area?
2) What could your team improve on in this area?
3) What is something new you would like to try or learn in this area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also ask these open-ended questions to help them come up with their responses:
What problems did you have? Do you want to learn any new programming techniques? Did you have time to do what you needed to do? Did you distribute the work between your teammates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to the three questions above can help the team focus on the next step - setting team goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-goals&quot;&gt;Setting Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every team is different and every team’s goals should be different. For one team, outreach and spreading FIRST might be the most important goal. For another, completing all the missions on the table. For some, it might be to make it to States. For others, it might be to use pneumatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of setting goals, we had our team watch five robot runs and five project presentations from any previous years by other teams. You can find videos on YouTube. We had them compare themselves with the other teams. What did the other team do that you liked or you would like to learn more about? The goal is not to copy the other team, but just for inspiration. This can be especially useful for a team that has not attended a post-season event. We do not recommend that you watch videos from the current season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked our team to think about what they would like to accomplish this season in each area of FIRST LEGO League. This was how we set team goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seshan Brothers&lt;br&gt;Animatronics&lt;br&gt;Pittsburgh, USA</name></author><summary type="html">What do you do at the start of the season?

You can also ask these open-ended questions to help them come up with their responses:
What problems did you have? Do you want to learn any new programming techniques? Did you have time to do what you needed to do? Did you distribute the work between your teammates?

The answers to the three questions above can help the team focus on the next step - setting team goals.

Setting Goals

Every team is different and every team’s goals should be different. For one team, outreach and spreading FIRST might be the most important goal. For another, completing all the missions on the table. For some, it might be to make it to States. For others, it might be to use pneumatics.

As part of setting goals, we had our team watch five robot runs and five project presentations from any previous years by other teams. You can find videos on YouTube. We had them compare themselves with the other teams. What did the other team do that you liked or you would like to learn more about? The goal is not to copy the other team, but just for inspiration. This can be especially useful for a team that has not attended a post-season event. We do not recommend that you watch videos from the current season.

We asked our team to think about what they would like to accomplish this season in each area of FIRST LEGO League. This was how we set team goals.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/Butler/Passion/1/img/3.png" /></entry></feed>
