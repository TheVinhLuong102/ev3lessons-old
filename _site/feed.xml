&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborating on a physical task&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coordinating movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boxes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrapping Paper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scissors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setup:&lt;/b&gt;
Leave items on table jumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instructions to Team:&lt;/b&gt;
Your team has to wrap as many gifts as possible in 10 minutes. Each member of the team can only do one task (and only touch that one item - paper, scissors, tape, box).  Work together to wrap as many presents as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt;
1) If you have a larger team, add some more items such as ribbons, name on the gift, etc.
2) Make the task longer if you need to.
2) Variations: Wrap the present but everyone can only use one hand, one blindfolded is the only one allowed to wrap (everyone else can see), wrap without talking.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Ann Francis&lt;/strong&gt;
My team meets 4.5 hours/week (1.5 hours one evening during the week and 3 hours on either Friday or Saturday depending on my work schedule and kids’ availability. We’re a home school team, so that makes scheduling meetings a little more flexible).
 I have a co-coach who takes care of all of the administrative stuff. She also works with the parents to work with the kids to do most of the Project work. I come in at the end and ask all the annoying questions that cause them to need/want to do more research. And I handle Core Values and Robot Design/Game coaching pretty much all myself. It’s a lot, but it actually works pretty well as it allows me to incorporate more Core Values activities in with the robot stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Graffin&lt;/strong&gt;
 I’ve been running two teams pretty much solo, with some extra assitance for the past two years. With the amount of hours we put in, I’d definitely recommend extra pairs of hands. I don’t want to go through this again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evonne Reynolds&lt;/strong&gt;
I’m estimating about 40 hours total with the kids. I’m really the only coach (a parent is listed as assistant coach with FIRST but she really just orders tshirts). My parents are great about helping with displays/posters at the end but I do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Koop&lt;/strong&gt;
My team of 8 (4th &amp;amp; 5th graders) met 11 times for a total of 16.5 hours before our qualifier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Langston Saylor&lt;/strong&gt;
I meet with my team twice a week from 3:30-5pm. The last two weeks however we have had extended practices due to our upcoming qualifying competition. We went m-f same hours last week and this week we met Monday and Tuesday 3:30-6pm. I am the head coach with an assistant. We also have a parent that helps out on occasion too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Graffin&lt;/strong&gt;
We did nearly 60, once you factored in the extra lunchtime, before school sessions, and weekends. I hope to do it a bit smarter next season - as this one almost killed me. Most of the time, both teams trained and prepared alongside eachother. That, I would do again - it was beneficial for our new members&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asha Seshan&lt;/strong&gt;
 In answer to your other question - 2 coaches are a requirement to register a team these days…and honestly, is probably needed. Parents pitching in here and there is very useful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan Evans&lt;/strong&gt;
Totally an average. I had kids that spent every lunch time in my room and took home programming books and researched ev3lessons in their own time. I had other kids I had to motivate daily!
Jeff Hagan We (a community team) normally do 2 practices a week of 2 hours each, but with a few extra sessions leading up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melanie Somogie&lt;/strong&gt;
We are a parent led at school group. We met 2x/wk for 2 hrs, some longer Saturdays. Honestly, Saturday meetings were much more productive because after school the kids were less focused and part of the time was spent unwinding and getting a snack before work actually started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don Tippet&lt;/strong&gt;
We practice twice a week, two hours each time. Add to that two or three prop building parties along with volunteering for local FLL events, helping other teams, etc…Our qualifier is always the second or third Saturday in December. The one thing I always look at the week before qualifiers is health of the kids. Typically during this week we are sharing our project once or twice, helping set up the qualifier, etc…. And on top of all that, flu season is kicking into full gear. I have noticed sickness creeping in to the team in years past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Sarisky&lt;/strong&gt;
We had one at-school meeting that had nearly 100% attendance, 2 hrs/week. Then we had a two-hour weekend meeting at my house, where attendance ran about 50% most weeks, mostly the same kids.  Some weeks some of them did an hour or two of other work. If it was very very specific exactly what they should do, sometimes the parents would nudge them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laila Qn&lt;/strong&gt;
In the lead up to our National Competition we practiced Monday and Thursday 4-6pm and on Saturday and Sunday 9-3pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asha Seshan&lt;/strong&gt;
For my team, the Droids, the hours changed over the years. Year one was 2 hrs on a Friday…and then 4 added on a Saturday a month into the season. The number of hours has steadily increased each year in the program. For the Droids, FLL became year-round many years ago. My kids invest a lot of time into the program as a whole (beyond their own competition work) which is what accounts for the large number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karla Stevens&lt;/strong&gt;
We meet once a week for 2.5 hours. We have some extra meetings - but those are optional as all of the kids have lots of other activities too. Extra meetings are usually only attended by a few kids - but they get more done with fewer kids so it works out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angelica G. Salazar&lt;/strong&gt;
We meet twice a week for two hours. The last two weeks one of those meetings becomes a 3hr meeting. And usually we add a third meeting the last week before qualifier, just for extra practice and poster making.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Asha Seshan&lt;br&gt;Droids Robotics&lt;br&gt;Pittsburgh, USA&lt;br&gt;</name></author><summary type="html">How many hours do you think that your team met before the first competition?

&lt;p&gt;I ask teams, “Are you ever directly competing with anyone or any team in FIRST LEGO League?” The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your competition is the obstacle on the board. Your competition is the real-world problem you are trying to solve. All you do on the day of a qualifier is bring your best. Your best robot. Your best explanations. Your best examples. Your best teamwork. You are COMPETING with no one. You are just offering the best you have, in the best way you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can that best be improved? ALWAYS. But that’s not the issue. You do the best you can on that day, and then you look at how you did, and you learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best team can freeze up. The least organized team can have everything work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the qualifier is the last event you attend this year, look at all that you learned! You stretched your knowledge of robots. You practiced presentations. You worked on a project MANY degrees of difficulty higher than your grade level, and you expanded your (and others’!) knowledge of a problem facing the modern world! YOU ARE A HERO!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-trophy-is-a-piece-of-plastic-the-knowledge-tools-and-skills-you-build-in-fll-are-a-lever-that-you-can-use-to-move-the-world&quot;&gt;A trophy is a piece of plastic. The knowledge, tools and skills you build in FLL are a lever that YOU can use to move the world.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a personal reflection from Kaia, a fifth year FIRST LEGO League veteran, about her place on an FLL team. This article has been reposted on EV3Lessons with permission from Kaia and Team Xanterra. To learn more about Xanterra, visit their &lt;a href=&quot;http://nirostem.org&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xanterra---job-descriptions&quot;&gt;Xanterra - Job Descriptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my 5 years of FLL, I have learned many things including the fact that some people succeed at and enjoy certain parts of the program more than others. This is part of what inspired us to create jobs for all of the team members to allow them to focus a little more of their time on what they enjoy. For example, my passion is writing so the job ‘Master Scribe’ is the perfect fit for me. This give me the chance to focus on writing while also being part of the project, robot game, and the core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first started implementing jobs mid-season last year. To come up with jobs, we brainstormed with our team until we had more than enough ideas and a wide variety to allow everyone to have multiple ones to pick from. After that we said which one we wanted the most and then compromised in places where more than one person thought they would be a good fit for the title. In the end, we all got a job that we were happy with and could all contribute something unique to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time we have defined our jobs in more detail. This is a list of our current job descriptions and how we contribute our specialties to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caleigh – Core Values Lead: Leading team building activities. Making sure everyone is being included in activities &amp;amp; that core values are being followed in day-to-day activities. Leading the production of core values posters &amp;amp; presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaia – Master Scribe: Keeps the team organized in both note taking &amp;amp; record keeping, and gets us prepared for competitions. She creates &amp;amp; maintains a blog with the purpose of sharing our experiences &amp;amp; ideas with others in FLL &amp;amp; in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol Lin – Robot Design Lead: Her job is to have knowledge of general and complex concepts of robot building to assist the rest of the team in keeping the robot in working condition, in good maintenance &amp;amp; to assist them when they need help with their design ideas or troubleshooting problems. She copies our attachments into the Lego Digital Designer program and works with teammates to have at least a general knowledge of how their attachments work in case of their absence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma – Spirit: She keeps the morale of the team up by helping anyone having a tough time by being positive &amp;amp; making sure everyone is being included. She leads the team in coming together at the end of meetings to do a team chant to celebrate our progress &amp;amp; encourage unity. She also creates team cheers and teaches them to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dalton – Piecekeeper: He organizes and puts pieces away that aren’t being used.  He also keeps the robot building area clean and encourages others on the team to keep pieces picked up. He puts the robot &amp;amp; the attachments away in the storage room at the end of meetings and checks the robot tables at the beginning of each meeting as well as of at competition to make sure they are set up properly. He also communicates any issues found on the table to the refs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austin – Project Lead: He takes the lead on the project research and leads the team in ideas and development of the project. He helps create a creative project presentation and documents all the project research to create a project research binder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caleb – Programming Lead: Goes through everyone’s programs with them and makes notes about what each part of the program does. For the competition, he makes sure the programs being used are downloaded on the robot, are in order, and are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cody – Timekeeper: At the competition, he keeps track of time and makes sure we are where we need to be on time. He overlooks our Kanban organizational chart that helps us keep track of our team goals in a “to do, doing &amp;amp; done” fashion throughout the season to ensure everything gets done by competition. He also times the robot rounds during practices to make sure we do not go over the time limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conner – Robot Manager: At competition, he makes sure that the robot is monitored and cared for properly at all times. He helps design the robot &amp;amp; attachments in LEGO Digital Designer along with the Robot Design Lead. At each meeting, he checks for challenge updates and prints copies of any updates for all team members to place in their binders. He leads the team in writing the RDES.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kaia&lt;br&gt;Xanterra&lt;br&gt;Coeur d'Alene, Idaho</name></author><summary type="html">Every team is different, but every student on a team should have a role to play.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to work together to complete a logic puzzle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think together as a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One copy of a logic puzzle from sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logic-puzzles.org/&quot;&gt;Logic-Puzzles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setup:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave the puzzle and pencil on the table (or have them work on the puzzle together online.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instructions to Team:&lt;/b&gt;
In each puzzle you are given a set of categories, and options within each category. Your goal is to figure out which options are linked together based on the clues provided with the puzzle. You have 5 minutes to solve the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt;
Given teams only have 5mintues, try to pick logic puzzles that are smaller (they come in different sizes).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pink Piranhas&lt;br&gt;Melbourne, FL</name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/Butler/Passion/1/img/3.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Buying Parts</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/coachcorner/2017/11/28/Buying-Parts.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Buying Parts" /><published>2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/coachcorner/2017/11/28/Buying-Parts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/coachcorner/2017/11/28/Buying-Parts.html">&lt;p&gt;As your team progresses through the season, you might find that they are running out of parts. It is common to need parts beyond the FIRST LEGO League or Edu MINDSTORMS sets. In FIRST LEGO League, all LEGO-branded parts are permitted, with a few exceptions (e.g. Power Functions and wind-up are not allowed, Sound sensors and Infrared sensors are not allowed, etc). Be sure you read the current year’s Challenge Documents for details as what is and is not allowed may change from year-to-year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/coachcorner/Parts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-order-sets-motors-and-sensors&quot;&gt;How do I order sets, motors and sensors?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To order complete sets, sensors and motors, you can visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lego.com&quot;&gt;LEGO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legoeducation.com&quot;&gt;LEGO Education&lt;/a&gt;.  The LEGO Education Core and Expansion Sets combined are the FIRST LEGO League set sold at the time of team registration. The Home Edition of the EV3 can be purchased from many retailers including Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Toys R Us. To read about the differences between the two sets, read &lt;a href=&quot;http://ev3lessons.com/coachcorner/2017/01/17/Home-vs-Edu.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lego.com&quot;&gt;LEGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legoeducation.com&quot;&gt;LEGO Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-know-what-the-part-is-called&quot;&gt;How do I know what the part is called?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To order a specific part, you will need to know the LEGO part number. Some LEGO elements have their number printed on them. For most, you will need to look up the part number on the inventory list for the set it came from.  For example, the Education Edition of the EV3 Core Set is #45544.  The Home Edition version of the EV3 is #31313.  If you use a site such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://brickset.com/&quot;&gt;Brickset&lt;/a&gt;, you can look up what elements are in the set.  For example, type in “45544” in the Search bar on BrickSet. Then, pick “Parts”. It will show you the name, part number, and all the other sets the piece comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-team-bought-the-31313-home-edition-set-but-want-to-buy-the-parts-to-make-it-a-45544-education-edition-set&quot;&gt;Our team bought the 31313 Home Edition set, but want to buy the parts to make it a 45544 Education Edition Set&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebrickable.com/compare/31313-1/45544-1/&quot;&gt;comparison tool&lt;/a&gt; is also a handy way to find the part numbers in both EV3 sets quickly. Just order the parts that are not in the 31313 set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-can-i-buy-specific-parts-from&quot;&gt;Where can I buy specific parts from?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know the name and part number, you can order that specifc part from stores on Bricklink and Brickowl by entering the element number in the search bar.  If you cannot find the element number, type the name and it will pull up all closely related elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips: (Special thank you to Catherine Sarisky for several of the tips below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you purchase from Bricklink or Brickowl sites, make sure you pick a store with good reviews and lots of purchases. If you want to receive your items faster, pick someone local. You can purchase both new and used parts. Make sure that the vendor ships to your country. Sellers care about their reviews and generally sell what they list, check components, etc, and are happy to fix any errors in the shipment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you purchase from LEGO Pick A Brick, please be aware that parts may take several weeks to arrive. This could be an issue for a team on a schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When using eBay look for high rankings, read product descriptions, and look carefully at photos. Prices are not always lower and quality or item might not be exactly what the image shows. Sometimes listings that say “complete” are not complete. Electronics may or may not be tested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goodwill sales are as is. You might get a good deal or you may not. Nothing is tested and electronics might be broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-can-i-buy-first-lego-league-challenge-mats-from&quot;&gt;Where can I buy FIRST LEGO League Challenge Mats from?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIRST LEGO League challenge mats are not easily available. You can try marketplace sites such as eBay. You can usually find sets from a past season. Post your request on your local FIRST LEGO League Forum or Listserv. Sometimes teams are willing to sell them at the end of the season.  In addition, contact your Tournament Director. Some of them do loan or sell their sets at the end of the season.  A good substitute for FLL challenges is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/ev3-space-challenge-set/45570&quot;&gt;Space Challenge&lt;/a&gt; by LEGO Education.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seshan Brothers&lt;br&gt;Droids Robotics&lt;br&gt;Pittsburgh, USA</name></author><summary type="html">As your team progresses through the season, you might find that they are running out of parts.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-so-much-to-do-and-a-tournament-approaching&quot;&gt;There is so much to do and a tournament approaching…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one week till the competition and the kids seem to not be getting anything done. They are playing and not taking anything seriously. What do you do? This is more common than you might think and many coaches have felt the frustration of their team not understanding the urgency of getting it all done. Time for the coach to take a deep breath and evaluate the teams’ goals vs. your own. Read the comments below from dozens of experienced coaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response by Chris Mullis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a deep breath, you’ll be surprised what they have learned when you go to tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response by Evonne Reynolds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know what their goal is? Do they just want to have fun even if they don’t score well? Or do they care about the score? If they care about the scores then ask them what they think they need to get done in the next week to accomplish that score. Likely you’ll have to keep reminding them to stay in task but hopefully they’ll step up and at least try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response by Asha Seshan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t cry. It’s the kids’ contest…if they don’t care or don’t want to work on it, that is up to them. If they want to reach a particular goal, great. If they have a different goal from you/Coach, that is fine too. Remind them of their goal and the timeline and let them decide what they want to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response by Jumi Kalita&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could cry with you!!😏😩 I am facing exactly the same situation. So many times, I feel like taking over their project and doing it myself!! But I know that would defeat the purpose!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response by Catherine Sarisky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think many of us share your frustration. After winning their qualifier, my team was all like “we are going to work really hard for state”. We wrote some goals. Then nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we just have to admit that it’s their competition, and they get to decide how to do it. As coaches, more than that risks messing up the fun, and not having a team next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m totally building a 300+ point robot in two weeks when their season is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karine Voinot Josien&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had one year like that after we split the existing team into FLL and FTC. The kids remaining in FLL did not realize how much the older ones had been doing while they were goofing off the previous years. By the time they got it, it was too late. But this was a learning experience for them and they stepped up the following year and brought home a trophy from state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know what the kid’s goals are, it helps to put up a “to finish” board. Not to do, to finish! Have them help you write it! Then they know what needs to be completed before the competition. Sometimes they really do think they are on track because they do not grasp what is needed. Hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the kids deal - if they don’t step up, it is okay. Remember they are busy - this isn’t the only thing they have going on. And so they may be more interested in just having fun. They will have still gotten something out of it. If at the tournament they are serious, have them use the in between time to get ready for each thing - practice for the project just before they go in, go over core values just before they go in, etc. If not, it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had that moment today. But I had to buckle down. We conquered the easiest task first. Lol, I feel your frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wise man told me that first year teams are never ready. I’ve been at this for a while and agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel your pain for some reason this year I feel behind and unprepared.. we pretty much have project just need a skit and finish out board.. robot on the other hand has not been consistent and our competition is in two and a half weeks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let them go to tournament. They will totally get it…. for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response by Michael Graffin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, I hope, they haven’t dropped the robot two days before the comp. It is essential that the team attends their tournament - those that learn the lessons from the season are those you’ll want back next year. Robot consistency drove us nuts these first two years. Good luck&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Various</name></author><summary type="html">The following discussion is quoted from the Facebook Group FLL: Share &amp;amp; Learn .</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/Butler/Passion/1/img/3.png" /></entry></feed>
