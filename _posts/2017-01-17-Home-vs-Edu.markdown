One of the most common questions we receive is about the difference between the three MINDSTORMS sets available to FIRST LEGO League teams: <b>Home Edition</b>, <b>Education Edition</b>, and the <b>FIRST LEGO League Bundle edition</b>. We decided to put together a comparison sheet to help coaches decide what to buy. 

![](/images/coachcorner/Versions.jpg)

### Three MINDSTORMS options for teams

There are three different versions of the MINDSTORMS set you can buy for your team. As you look through the table below, notice that the retail set has a sensor not permitted in FIRST LEGO League (infrared, IR beacon) and the Edu and FLL versions do come with a rechargeable battery, gyro and ultrasonic sensors that teams find useful. The versions also have slightly different LEGO elements in them (e.g. slightly larger wheels and a ball wheel in the Edu edition, but a ball shooter, balls, and many decorative elements in the retail edition.)  Under the "Useful Links" section below, you can find a nice comparison tool that displays what parts are in each set.

Also remember that in FIRST LEGO League, you can use LEGO elements beyond these three sets. All LEGO-branded elements (including motors, sensors, rubberbands, etc.) are permitted. However, you are not allowed to use the infrared sensor and the infrared beacon.  You are allowed to use LEGO elements in any Technic and LEGO sets you may own. However, you are not allowed to use Power Functions motors, windup LEGO elements, and the NXT sound sensor.  FIRST LEGO League also permits 4 motors (but only 3 come in any one set).  Therefore, keep in mind what other parts you might want to purchase for your team beyond these basic sets.

### All versions are compatible

The single biggest mistake people make is assuming that the sets and the software are very different. They are not. You are NOT limited or restricted because of the set you start with.  All components in the sets are interchangable and you can very easily purchase additional parts. The software between the sets is identical.

- You can purchase parts not in one set (e.g. charger, battery, sensors) seperately from LEGO.com, LEGOEducation.com, Bricklink, etc.<br>
- You can change the firmware on the brick from one edition (Home or Edu) to the other. <br> 
- You can change the software from one edition to the other (Home or Edu) on the computer.
