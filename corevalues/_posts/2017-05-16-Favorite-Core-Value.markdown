<b>Objectives:</b>
- Coming up with a team identity
- Making a decision quickly
- Learn the Core Values

<b>Materials:</b>
- Large sheet of paper - Markers

<b>Setup:</b>
Provide teams with the materials

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
In the middle of the paper write your team's favorite Core Value. Decorate the rest of the page with why this is your team's favorite Core Value.' You have 5 minutes to complete this task.

<b>Notes:</b>
This activity is designed to help teams think about their team identity as well as the Core Values. At the end of 5 minutes, have the team present their poster and explain their choices. You might do this same activity twice in the season (once at the beginning and once at the end) to see if the team perceives itself differently.
