<b>Objectives:</b>
- Learning to work together and coordinate

<b>Materials:</b>
- Pens or pencils (enough for each pair of students on the team)

<b>Setup:</b>
Leave items on table.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Everyone pick a partner. Each of you may only use one finger - one of you should touch the tip of the pencil and the other only the eraser. Work together to keep the pencil upright between your two fingers. Next, walk from one end of the room to the other while holding the pencil upright together

<b>Notes:</b>
What was the most difficult part of this challenge? How did team members communicate or coordinate?
Variations can include 1) Placing obstacles in the room, 2) Timing the teams to see who
is the fastest, 3) Increasing the number of people holding pencils from two to three or four (as in the photo above)
