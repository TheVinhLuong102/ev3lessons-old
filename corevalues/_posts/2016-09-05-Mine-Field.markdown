<b>Objectives:</b>
- Trusting teammates
- Giving good instructions

<b>Materials:</b>
- Red paper, cushions or anything to represent mines on the floor
- Blindfold

<b>Setup:</b>
- Leave the “mines” in random places across the floor


<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Pick one teammate to be blindfolded. This person will have to cross the room blindfolded only with the help of his/her teammates.

<b>Notes:</b>
Listen to see if your team talks over each other and how they come up with a system of giving instructions to the person who was blindfolded.

In the image above, the mines were columns in the room, and cushions on the floor.
