<b>Objectives:</b>
- Learn to work together to complete a logic puzzle
- Think together as a team

<b>Materials:</b>
- One copy of a logic puzzle from sites such as <a href="http://www.logic-puzzles.org/">Logic-Puzzles</a>

<b>Setup:</b>
- Leave the puzzle and pencil on the table (or have them work on the puzzle together online.)

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
In each puzzle you are given a set of categories, and options within each category. Your goal is to figure out which options are linked together based on the clues provided with the puzzle. You have 5 minutes to solve the puzzle.

<b>Notes:</b>
Given teams only have 5mintues, try to pick logic puzzles that are smaller (they come in different sizes).
