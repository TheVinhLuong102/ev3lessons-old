<b>Objectives:</b>
- Learning to work together and coordinate

<b>Materials:</b>
- Team Members
- Floor Space

<b>Setup:</b>
Leave items on table.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Create the word “FLL” with your body. It does not matter whether you are standing or lying on the ground. More than one team member may be part of the same letter.

<b>Notes:</b>
What was the most difficult part of this challenge? How did team members make decisions or coordinate? Was there a discussion? What was the difference between making words vs. symbols vs. each person creating their own character? Variations can include 1) Replace with any short word of symbol (e.g. smiley face), 2) Give a word with as many letters as team members so each person is only one letter.
